Radix-Sort-vs-Linked-List-Sort
==============================

This repository includes my own implementation of Radix sort to work on groups of strings. It also includes an implementation of the very slow linked list sort, and a main file to test the respective speed of the two sorts on a large set of names. I created this for the CS212 Advanced Data Structures class at GCC
